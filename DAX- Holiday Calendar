Calculate difference in days for working days.

Step 1:
Import/ create a Holidat Table

Step 2:
Create the following column in Date table to check whether the day is a Saturday or Sunday
IsWorkingDay = IF (NOT('Date'[DayofWeek]= "Saturday" || ('Date'[DayOfWeek]= "Sunday")) && COUNTX(RELATEDTABLE('Holiday List'),1)<1,1,0)

Step 3:
Create a connection between holiday table and date table by joining

Step 4:
Now calculate the difference between two dates by using the following Dax
Working Days = CALCULATE(SUM('Date'[IsWorkingDay]),
           DATESBETWEEN('Date'[Date],'Table'[Date1], 
                        'Table'[Date2]))
